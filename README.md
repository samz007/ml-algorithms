**Overview**

This repo is a perfect place for most of the people who are willing to start implementing their knowledge about machine learning algorithms.
After studying the statistical and mathematical concepts about machine learning algorithms, someone can hardly resist to start coding for them. 
This repository covers python implementation of several algorithms 
in supervised and unsupervised learning.

**Data pre-processing and List of Algorithms**

Before implementing any algorithm of classification or regression, it is essential to analyze the data available. Moreover, data can be converted into more useful information if appropriately processed before use.
Data pre-processing template can be used as a preliminary step before implementing most of the algorithms mentioned below.

`Classification:`
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Decision Tree
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Support Vector Machine 

`Regression:`
* Simple Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* Support Vector Regression

`Clustering:`
*  Hierarchical Clustering
*  K-Means Algorithm

`Reinforcement Learning`
* Thompson_Sampling
* UCB
* Apriori Algorithm
